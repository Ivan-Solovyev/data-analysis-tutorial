# Signal extraction

    * Fitting a signal:
      - Chi-square and maximum likelyhood fits.
      - Extended and non-extended fits.
    * Uncertainty validation using Toy-Monte-Carlo.
    * Distributions for a signal and a background components:
      - Sideband subtruction;
      - Fit-in-bin technique;
      - _sPlot_ unfolding techinque.

## Homework

### Tasks

  1. Create a toy moded lwith fixed parametrs containing peaking signal (30%) and a bakgrounds of two cathegories: peaking (10&) and smooth (40%).
  2. For the 3000 events find an optimal binning for the chi2 fits
  3. Compare outcome and performance of the binned chi2 fit and unbinneb maximum likelihood fit for different statistics of:
      - 50 events
      - 3000 events
      - 100000 events
  4. Validate uncertainties of the unbinned maximum likelihood fit for 3000 events.
  5. Compare parameters of the extended and non-extended maximum likelihood fits (50 and 3000 events).
  6. Add a non-correlated variable with differentr shapes for signal and a backgrounds. 
   Try to extract the distribution of the signal for this variable with three methods;

### Expected outcome
  * Document in pdf-format containig proper information 
  * Add code into your git repository
