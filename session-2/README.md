# Cut-based techique.

  * How to find best requirements?
  * Are requirements optimal?
    - Fluctuations
    - Look elswhere effect
    - When to use signal for background rejection optimisations?

## Homework

### Tasks
  1. For the Lambda_c dataset find an optimar requirements.
  2. Create a bunch of a thousand toy background only datasets of three variables: one a discriminating and two for selection. Find a dataset with a lagrest gaussian-like fluctuation on a discriminating variable.
  3. Detrmine a local and a global significance of the "signal".
  4. "Optimize" requirements on two control variable to reach a besl local significance.

### Expected outcome
 1. A PDF report
 2. Code in git repository
