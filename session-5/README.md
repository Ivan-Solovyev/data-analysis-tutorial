# Dealing with Monte-Carlo
  * How to re-weight MC to data?
  * Weighted fit for efficiency evaluation.
  * How to estimate efficiency for not-well reconstructed events?
  
## Homework

### Tasks
  1. Re-weight an MC dataset to the data for three variables: transverce momentum, rapidity and multiplisity.
  2. Oprimize a signal selection requirements using re-wighted MC for signal and sidebands for the background.
  3. Detemine a particle identification efficiency as a function of pseudorapidity and transverse momentum for the dataset and the efficiency map provided by a teacher.
  4. Estimate signal selection efficency for the B-mesons using MC. Compare results of the naive and accurate estimation.

### Expected outcome
  1. Reaort
  2. Code
